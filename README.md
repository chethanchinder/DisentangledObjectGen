# Object Mesh generator with disentagled topology and shape
Deep learning model to generate the 3D  objects given the class id , latent code of object shape and pose.

This code is heavily based on the Original paper Neural Template: Topology-aware Reconstruction and Disentangled Generation of 3D Meshes ( (https://github.com/edward1997104/Neural-Template)
